# Humid-Air-Simulation-on-GPU
This is my two-year plan, and I hope to complete it on time and graduate successfully.

## Allocate memory 
Using C code to allocate and free memory and test if it work!

## 1D Heat Transfer Simulation in Air

Information on the 1D Heat transfer simulation of air can be found [here](./1D_Heat_Transfer_Simulation_in_Air/README.md)

## Sine-wave
This is for practicing how to transfer calculation results from C code to MATLAB for plotting. 

The results can be viewed by clicking [here](./sine_wave/README.md).

## Perform_1D_humidity_simulation_in_Air
Information on the 1D Humidity simulation of air can be found [here](./Perform_1D_humidity_simulation_in_Air/READE.md)

## 1D_Shallow_Water
This code uses c language to simulation 1D Shallow water problem, and use Rusanov method to calculate flux.

More informations are in [here](./1D-Shallow-water/README.md)

## Exact_Riemann_Solver_1D_Euler
The flux computation part of this code was provided by Prof. Smith. Its purpose is to obtain the exact solution to the 1D Euler equation, allowing for cross-comparison with results from other solvers later on.

More informations are in [here](Exact_Riemann_Solver_1D_Euler)

## Rusanov_1D_Euler
This code utilizes the Rusanov method to calculate flux and compares the results against the Exact Riemann solver.
