# Humid-Air-Simulation-on-GPU
This is my two-year plan, and I hope to complete it on time and graduate successfully.

## Allocate memory 
Using C code to allocate and free memory and test if it work!

## 1D Heat Transfer Simulation in Air

Information on the 1D Heat transfer simulation of air can be found [here](./1D_Heat_Transfer_Simulation_in_Air/README.md)

## Sine-wave
This is for practicing how to transfer calculation results from C code to MATLAB for plotting. The results can be viewed by clicking [here](./sine_wave/README.md).
